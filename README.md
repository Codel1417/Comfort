# VRC Comfort

VRChat lacks accessibility and comfort options. I aim to fix this without resorting to Modifying the client. Why? Because i suffer from vision sensitivity and VRChat refuses to offer any accessibility options.

### Is this malicious?

No since its local only. Unless you intentionally disable the local only check

### Does this help improve performance?

probably not, Might even hurt performance

### Why is this needed?

There are too many VRChat worlds that do not offer options to disable/control Post Processing or AudioLink. To some people these are minor things or can affect the "experience" of the world.

## Included Tools

### Post Processing Blocker

This disables post processing completely. The downside is Nameplates are also hidden.

### AudioLink Blocker

This disables most AudioLink features to reduce motion in the world.

### Sun flare blocker

This is simply a collider to block unity flare effects.
